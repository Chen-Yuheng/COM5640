          <h2 style="font-size: 40px">Background</h2>
          <p class="p2" align="justify">I was born in Xiamen, a slow-paced and cozy islet situated on the southeast coast of mainland China. I spent my first eighteen years growing up in Xiamen so that I can communicate well in Hokkien. I always miss my hometown, as it is the place where I can truly slow down to feel the sea breeze and sense the lively details of life.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 40px">Education</h2>
          <p class="p3" align="justify">In 2013, I travelled to Beijing for undergraduate study and it was the first time I had been so far from home. I majored in English (Business Journalism) at University of International Business and Economics. Although I was basically an English-majored student, I still took lessons in journalism and public communicationas, as my major is characterized by its combined focus over both linguistics and business journalism. Thus, I learnt about communication theories, new media studies as well as issues around media industry in China, and I also got shortly trained in English business news writing, public relations strategy developing and composing critical commentary over high-profile events. During the Black Friday last year, I wrote <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rvO0MBDbwV_kmieoa7dG3A" target="_blank">a commentary</a> over the yearly Black Friday fever from psychological and cultural perspectives, which was finally published by my teacher on her new-media public account in WeChat.</p>

          <p class="p4" align="justify">Later in my junior year, I went on the exchange program to Loyola University in Chicago. Beside Lake Michigan, I was devoted to theatrical learning. We read a mass of play texts every week, composed monologues frequently, and did performances at the end of the semester. The course was quite demanding, but what I ultimately got from it turned out be fruitful. In the spare time, my friends and I didn’t miss the chance to get a taste of American culture. Especially, we watched NBA games in Chicago Bulls’ United Center which we had never thought of before. During the semester, we also took trips to Washington and Los Angeles.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 40px">Extracurricular Activities</h2>
          <p class="p5" align="justify">In the first two years of my undergraduate life, I took active part in student activities. I first took the job as a column editor for the self-generated magazine of our school and was mainly taking charge of inspecting and modifying contributions from students. However, it is the time spent with the Arts Department of our school student union that I treasure most. In two years’ time, I got started from a usual member and then was elected as the vice director in the second year. Together with a group of innovative and tasteful people, I participated in the organizing of Singing Competitions and English Theatre Festivals of our university. We made it through all the tough processes on our own, including developing promotion activities and producing most of the video clips shown in the final. And It was during that time that I learnt to edict videos by Adobe AE and sharpened my promotion copy writing skills. <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MTQ1ODIzNg==&mid=201358339&idx=2&sn=5aaadae8f24362f5f4ef3a6baf6f7e45&scene=38#wechat_redirect" target="_blank">There</a> is one of the soft advertising copies I generated for a promotion activity.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 40px">Professional Experiences</h2>
          <p class="p6" align="justify">When I came back from the US, everything seemed to step on the high way. I set off on my first internship in Yusys Technologies Corporation, a financial IT company in Beijing. I worked for their marketing department, but my foremost job was to assist in their preparation for the annual gala. I was assigned to develop citations for awarded employees and process video clips to be shown on the gala. Finally, the result was gratifying. And <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ki_0HlQ9-cVDbCJ172G4cw" target="_blank">this</a> is a news report about the gala. My second internship was more journalism-related. Last September, I started to work as an intern news editor in Phoenix New Media, taking charge of news gathering, editing and weekly competitive analyses. Compared with my last internship, the news editing job had less creative processes and put more emphasis on high degree of news sensitivity and the quantity of outputs. Soon I felt work like this that just to mechanically transport news content from one site to another might not really suit me, but I didn’t give it up until the end of the semester. <a href="http://news.ifeng.com/a/20160923/50013656_0.shtml" target="_blank">Here</a> is one of the many pieces of news I edited and published on Phoenix's website, at the end of which my name is recorded.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 40px">Career Aspiration and Plan</h2>
          <p class="p7" align="justify">Based on my previous experience, I hope the job I take in the future will be the one that endows individual creation with more time and space rather than chain one’s thoughts and talent in a sophisticated framework. Thus, I aspire to be a member among the advertising industry. I might not be among those from design or technical background, but I am trying to convert myself into a more tech-equipped man in the post-graduate study and eager to make full of all I have accumulated in wiring and design for my future career. If possible, I plan to start with a somewhat experienced advertising agency, spending my first couple of years learning, and then transfer to a small-scale company where I might have more space for my career development. And finally, in the last period of my career, I hope I can establish my own business.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 40px">Hobbies and Interests</h2>
          <li class="li1" align="justify">In my leisure time, the first thing I would like to do is playing sports. I am obsessed about soccer and basketball, either of which I play once a week. And I also go swimming in pleasant weather. Every time I do sports, I get refreshed. I used to be the captain of our school soccer team, but I find I am getting less competitive in ball games as I grow older.</li><br>
          <li class="li1" align="justify">The second thing I would spend my leisure time on is watching movies, no matter in the movie theater or just in my little bedroom. I am enchanted with DC comics, especially the Bat Man. The script that “Why do we fall, sir<span>？</span>So we can learn to pick ourselves up.” in the Bat Man series always encourages me to move on.</li><br>
          <li class="li1" align="justify">Last but not least, I like reading flowery proses or essays when I am completely relaxed. The work of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/%E9%BE%8D%E6%87%89%E5%8F%B0-Lung-Yingtai-1388668931448060/" target="_blank">Ms. Lung Ying-tai</a>, such as <span class="s1">A Long Gaze</span> and <span class="s1">Dear Andreas</span> are my exclusive favorite. Last month, I am so fortunate to meet her on the campus of CUHK, a writer whose work enlightened and inspired me so much when I was a teenager.</li>
